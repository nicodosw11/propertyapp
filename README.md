# LIVSTY, Think Property Investment Differently!

**Website**: [Livsty](https://www.livsty.co.uk) **Version 1.0.0**

Redefining the French viager system by reversing the scheme's cash-flow structure 

This is the MVP I have built for the startup LIVSTY. I have been working as a freelancer on this real-life start-up project as an introduction to programming/web development and while continuing learning. The final MVP is a crowdfunding platform where investors can buy shares in advertised properties.
